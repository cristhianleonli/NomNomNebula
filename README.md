# Nom Nom Nebula

> *Consume. Expand. Become the universe.*

## Overview

**Nom Nom Nebula** is a 2D pixel art merger/tactics game where you navigate your own galaxy with one goal: get as big as possible. Absorb other galaxies, manage your black hole stabilizer, and dodge the invisible threats lurking in the cosmic field — because out here, not everything can be eaten. Some things eat *you*.

This is an infinite progression game. There is no true win state — only your highest score, and the drive to beat it.

## Gameplay

### Core Loop

Galaxies drift toward you through gravitational attraction. Hover over them to reveal their **condition**, decide if you want it, and hold your absorption radius for **2 seconds** to consume them. Every absorption grows your galaxy — and raises the stakes.

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `WASD` | Move — your galaxy drifts in response |
| `Mouse Hover` | Reveal a galaxy's condition before absorbing |
| `Space + WASD` | Burst propulsion in your movement direction |

### Burst Mechanic

Your burst meter holds **2 charges**.

- Each burst moves your galaxy **8 pixels**
- Both bursts together cover the full **16-pixel absorption radius** — enough to fully escape another galaxy's pull
- Each burst lasts **1 second** with a **0.5 second lag** between them
- Once both charges are spent, the meter recharges over **3 seconds**

Use bursts wisely — they're your only escape tool.

## The Black Hole Stabilizer Meter

A pressure meter is always counting down. This is your **Black Hole Stabilizer** — it tracks how long your galaxy has gone without a new absorption.

- Absorbing a galaxy **resets the meter**
- If the meter hits **zero**, your galaxy collapses into itself — **game over**
- The larger you grow, the **faster the meter drains** and the more frequent your absorptions need to be
- Difficulty scales continuously the longer you survive

*You cannot coast. You must keep feeding.*

## The Galaxies

Six NPC galaxy types drift through the field. Each has a unique shape, color, and **condition** — a passive effect applied to your galaxy upon absorption. Hover your mouse over any galaxy to preview its condition before committing.

The **mini-map** color-codes incoming galaxies: **blue** for good conditions, **red** for bad ones.

### Smaller Galaxies

| Galaxy | Color | Shape | Condition Type |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Small 1** |  Orange | Barred (inspired) | Varies |
| **Small 2** |  Purple | Spiral | Varies |
| **Small 3** |  Green | Irregular | Varies |

### Larger Galaxies

| Galaxy | Color | Shape | Condition Type |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Large 1** |  Pink | Spiral | Varies |
| **Large 2** |  Blue | Elliptical | Varies |

*Each galaxy has a star at its center with surrounding pixel-art gas clouds. Low-poly by design — the focus is on motion, color, and feel.*

## Conditions

Every galaxy carries one condition. Choose carefully — absorbing the wrong one can make survival significantly harder.

### Good Conditions

| Condition | Rarity | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Extra Dashes** | Uncommon | +2 burst charges available |
| **Interaction Radius Factor** | Common | Absorption radius +20% |
| **Dash Pulse Factor** | Common | Propulsion range +50% |
| **Absorption Speed Factor** | Uncommon | Time to absorb a galaxy reduced by 50% |
| **Escaping Time** | Rare | +2 seconds to escape a black hole's radius |
| **Dash Recharge Factor** | — | Recharge time reduced to 1.5 seconds |
| **Warp Speed** | — | WASD movement speed +20% |

### Bad Conditions

| Condition | Rarity | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Exotic Matter** | Uncommon | Stabilizer max permanently shortened by 5 |
| **Control Type 1** | Uncommon | WASD controls switch to tank-style movement |
| **Control Type 2** | Common | Directional controls fully reversed (W = back, S = forward, etc.) |
| **-1 Dash** | Common | Burst limit reduced to 1 charge (same recharge time) |
| **Dash Recharge Factor** | — | Recharge time increased to 6 seconds |

## Black Holes

Black holes are **not visible** on the mini-map or screen — until you're already inside their radius.

- Approach one and it becomes visible, triggering a **QTE escape window**
- You must burst out of its **16-pixel absorption radius** in time
- If your galaxy is absorbed by a black hole — **game over**
- The rate of black hole spawns **increases the longer you survive**
- Your size at time of absorption is still recorded for your high score

> The field gets more dangerous the longer you last. Plan your path, not just your next meal.

---

## Scoring & Progression

Nom Nom Nebula is an **infinite score-chaser**. Every player will eventually lose — the goal is to outlast your own record.

Your score is based on how large your galaxy grows. After each run, the **Game Over screen** displays:
- Your **current run's size**
- Your **all-time highest score**

Push your limits. Beat yourself.

## Art Style

- **Style:** 2D pixel art, low-poly, top-down perspective
- **Palette:** Muted dark purples and blacks for space; each galaxy has its own color identity. The player galaxy starts **white** and takes on the colors of every galaxy absorbed.
- **Motion:** All galaxies are animated with a continuous spinning swirl
- **Lighting:** Flat lighting, soft glow, subtle shader effects on galaxies
- **Camera:** Follows the player's galaxy with a scrolling starfield background featuring twinkling stars

*Inspired by Stardew Valley's warmth mixed with the stark void of deep space.*
